# PacMen Exercise
## Overview
In this project we place a lot of PacMans in the screen and then let them run wild bouncing off the edges, all of this facilitated thanks to some JavaScript code.

## How To Run
Open the index.html file and then click as many times that you want on the button that says 'Add PacMan', once you are satiesfied with the number of PacMen in the screen click the 'Start Game' button and see all of PacMen run wild in your screen.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I know there might be some issues on the application, but I am not planning on working anymore on this project since it was already graded and unless I need to do so I won't update or upgrade it. I will be using the code learned from doing this exercise on other projects if applicable.
